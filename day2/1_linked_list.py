# CHALLENGE: 
# Implement a linked list structure that supports the four methods below:
#   add(): adds a new element to the list
#   get(): retrieves an element from the list given a zero-based index
#   size(): retrieves the number of elements in the list
#   delete() deletes an element from the list
#   traverse() prints every element in the list to the screen
# 
# 1. TRY to use as little memory as possible.
# 2. DO NOT worry about time performance or efficience.
# 3. You may NOT use any built-in data structures other than primitives 
# such as integers, strings, and your own structures.
# 
# Bonus: 
#   implement update() to replace an element in the list.
#   implement sort() to return a new, sorted list.
# 
# MODIFY THIS CODE ANY WAY YOU WANT.  The code below is just a starting point
# and not intended to imply any restrictions.
#
# UNCOMMENT THE TEST CODE at the end to verify that your code is working.
# 
class LinkedList:
  
    def add(self, value):
        pass

    def get(self, index):
        pass

    def size(self):
        pass

    def delete(self, value):
        pass
    
    def traverse(self):
        pass
        
# UNCOMMENT these lines as desired
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     my_list = LinkedList()
#     my_list.add(1)
#     my_list.add(10)
#     my_list.add(5)

#     assert 3 == my_list.size()
#     assert 10 == my_list.get(1)
#     my_list.traverse()
